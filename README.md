# honeycomb

honeycomb is a lightweight, decentralized peer-to-peer communication platform designed to address the critical gap in communication capabilities during disaster situations. Utilizing a Chord-based ring architecture, honeycomb ensures relatively fault-tolerant and scalable message delivery in the face of node failures and high churn. Through a combination of probabilistic message forwarding and periodic network maintenance, honeycomb enables efficient message propagation in low-bandwidth, high-failure environments without relying on a central server.
